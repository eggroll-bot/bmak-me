			This website is my first project created with React. When I started this project, I hadn't used JavaScript in about 4 years, so I had to
			practically re-learn the language, in addition to learning React's features. Learning the basics of React wasn't that difficult because
			the documentation for React is fairly detailed. I used the Material-UI library for most of the components in this website. Material-UI
			also has detailed documentation, so that made it easy to learn.
			`,
			`
			Overall, I'm fairly happy with how this website turned out. I will definitely be creating more React projects down the line.

			`
			The Huffman encoder and decoder uses the read( ) and write( ) system calls to perform reads and writes. The encoder uses a priority queue
			ADT to construct a Huffman tree and the decoder uses a stack ADT to rebuild the Huffman tree from the dump in the encoded output.
			`,
			`
			Implementing the priority queue ADT was a good learning experience because it was the first time I had implemented one. I originally was
			going to use a min-heap to implement it, but I figured that it would probably be more complicated than inserting into an ordered array.
			Given that the priority queue would only contain a maximum of 256 elements (one for each ASCII character), the implementation method I
			chose for the priority queue would not make a significant performance difference.
